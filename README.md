In JavaScript, callbacks, Promises, and async-await are all mechanisms for handling asynchronous operations. Here's a brief explanation of each:

**Callbacks:** Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed after the completion of some operation. They have been widely used in JavaScript for asynchronous programming.

**Promises:** Promises provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous operations compared to callbacks. A Promise represents a value which may be available now, or in the future, or never.

**Async-await:** Async-await is a modern way to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous, making it easier to read and understand.

In summary, while callbacks are the traditional way of handling asynchronous operations, Promises and async-await provide cleaner and more readable alternatives. Promises build upon the callback pattern, while async-await further simplifies asynchronous code by allowing you to write it in a synchronous style.
